    "I am interested in this project because I believe employee retention is a key component of building a successful business. I feel fortunate to live in a time where this type of scientific research is even possible! In the last decade new businesses' have emerged that offer their employees excellent salaries, benefits, stock-options, and working conditions. Many of these businesses, that forewent the traditional approach of paying the CEO six figures, (and the workers 'as little as possible'), have grown into very successful companies. While this dataset is a ficticious dataset created by IBM data scientists, I believe it was carefully designed to be a good representation of actual factors of attrition(I am hoping it is loosely 'based on' their internal data). I also believe IBM is an excellent company with excellent benefits. I believe I will see, within the many features, how their benefit's package supports employee retention. Through this evidence, I hope more companies will be encouraged to invest more in their own people; knowing that what is supportive of the people is supportive of the success of the organization."

Logistic Regression, with a c-statistic of 50, was ultimately the best model. The train accuracy was 89, validate 87, and finally tested at an accuracy score of 88%. This score beat baseline by four percent. \n",
